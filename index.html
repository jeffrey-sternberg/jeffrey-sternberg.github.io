    title: "Remote Work & Urbanization"
    excerpt: "My dissertation specifically looked at how remote work, and the new forms of mobility it allowed by untethering home and work, impacted urbanization and labor markets from a global cities & global political economy perspective pre-COVID, specifically looking at the consequences of opening up a global labor market while simultaneously creating a condition where localities could court labor instead of firms directly as a model for local economic development, using multi-sited ethnography and social network analysis to chart and understand the push and pull factors guiding and anchoring this form of labor mobility."

<h1> Biography </h1>
<p>My name is Jeff Sternberg and I received my PhD in Sociology from Northeastern University in 2021. I am a sociologist specializing in economic geography, computational social science, public policy and qualitative research methods. My career has spanned academia, municipal government and philanthropy. This website serves as my research portfolio.</p>

<p>I am interested in the intersection of development, the economy, and the state spatially, exploring these interactions through analysis of global inter-urban networks (mapping the global division of labor, internal domestic migration, regional and industrial collaboration, federal to state and municipal government interaction) and local intra-urban networks (city contracting networks and investment multipliers, community service provider collaboration, the intersection of labor and housing markets).</p>
