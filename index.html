My name is Jeff Sternberg and I am a sociologist specializing in economic geography, computational social science, public policy and qualitative research methods. My career has spanned academia, municipal government and philanthropy, but the main throughline across my work has been a concern with processes of development considered across and between different forms of place (urban versus rural, neighborhood versus neighborhood, global north versus global south, etc.) as they are more-or-less integrated into the economy at local, regional, and global levels which in turn reciprocally impacts the well-being of their local subsystems (housing, jobs, infrastructure, healthcare, social supports, etc.) and the quality of life residents are able to achieve.

I am interested in the intersection of development, the economy, and the state spatially, exploring these interactions through analysis of global inter-urban networks (mapping the global division of labor, internal domestic migration, regional and industrial collaboration, federal to state and municipal government interaction) and local intra-urban networks (city contracting networks and investment multipliers, community service provider collaboration, the intersection of labor and housing markets). 

While I am grounded and trained in both social science research and data science, the past few years I have been in leadership positions within governmental and philanthropic organizations, building and managing interdisciplinary teams of programmers, researchers, designers, writers and supporting staff to both create, gather, transform, and analyze administrative data from hundreds of community organizations in order to implement AI and machine learning methodology into organizational decision-making processes and produce research, policy, data tools, dashboards, websites, reports and one-pagers to provide guidance on state & philanthropic organizational strategy in program and city-investments. 

In this vein, my research has investigated inequality across and between communities in the US and comparatively globally, with an eye towards using research, data and digital technologies to directly guide public policy to intervene in these inequalities. Uneven development has served as my frame for understanding these processes and for researching interventions aimed at maximizing community well-being focused on sustainable & cooperative development and community wealth building which ,by their very nature, are centered on maximizing well-being, human flourishing and democratic participation over purely economic growth for its own sake. This research has sought to guide real world interventions, having been conducted within academic settings, but also directly within public health, community development, and governmental organizations.
