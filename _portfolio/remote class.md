Even though I have left the tenure-track behind, I am continuing to write and publish on my research projects which includes developing a book proposal, *Making the Remote Class*,  based on my dissertation for submission to university presses (Bloomsbury Academic & Verso).

This book chronicles a first salvo of pre-pandemic experiments put forward by digital nomads and those entering remote work’s horizon negotiating what the relationship between work and home, and ultimately labor and capital, could and should look like under conditions of location-independence – taking ethnographic stops at co-living spaces in the Global City of Los Angeles and the offbeat getaway of Dharamsala, India in the Himalayan foothills –  to reveal how changes in the global class structure engendered by remote work alter the possibilities for class formation, alliance and struggle around these terms, ultimately revealing the directions this struggle can and will take in the wake of the pandemic-induced massification of remote work.

> Remote work puts the possibility of negotiating the nature of the separation between work and home on the table on a scale that has not been possible since the birth of capitalism pushed workers from their village homes and the commons to the first urban industrial factories and working-class neighborhoods. In the past, negotiation between these terms could be attempted through either direct class struggle or mobility. Remote work presents a third strategy – decoupling work from a fixed location – not distinct from the other two, but one that can be used in direct collusion with either. The rapid take up of this possibility by workers has been clearly revealed by the massification of remote work heralded by the COVID-19 Pandemic but itself is not reducible to the technological innovations allowing for remote work, the exogenous shock of the pandemic, or even remote work itself; it is, also, the end result of decades of social, cultural, economic, and geographic shifts in the relationship between labor and place, work and home, that positioned workers to approach remote work that made such a takeoff possible. Remote work merely serves as one tool among others that various classes existing on a spectrum between the terms of labor and capital used to respond to these shifts, enable them, and augment their trajectory. These social, cultural, economic and geographic shifts of the past three decades have put some classes in a better position to grab onto remote work than others, some entering its domain voluntarily, others being pushed towards it, and still others being left unable to grasp it. The uneven expansion of remote work into the labor force has unmoored fragments of various classes from their spatially-relative class positions – their position in relation to production engendering a specific relation to spatially proximate markets for reproduction, i.e., housing, consumption, social networks, etc. – and thrown them into a state of anomic location-independent flux where they must make new connections to place and to each other. This book argues that this anomic space of location-independence serves as a field of class formation whereby these unmoored class fragments collide with each other and reshape themselves into a remote class whose new anchoring in space will alter both the labor sectors and reproductive markets they touch.
