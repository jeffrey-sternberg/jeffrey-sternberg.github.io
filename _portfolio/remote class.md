Even though I have left the tenure-track behind, I am continuing to write and publish on my research projects which includes developing a book proposal, Making the Remote Class,  based on my dissertation for submission to university presses (Bloomsbury Academic & Verso).

This book chronicles a first salvo of pre-pandemic experiments put forward by digital nomads and those entering remote work’s horizon negotiating what the relationship between work and home, and ultimately labor and capital, could and should look like under conditions of location-independence – taking ethnographic stops at co-living spaces in the Global City of Los Angeles and the offbeat getaway of Dharamsala, India in the Himalayan foothills –  to reveal how changes in the global class structure engendered by remote work alter the possibilities for class formation, alliance and struggle around these terms, ultimately revealing the directions this struggle can and will take in the wake of the pandemic-induced massification of remote work.
