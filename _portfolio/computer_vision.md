The online world has become one of the primary ways people construct, present, and reconstruct their identities - particularly younger generations - and images are rapidly becoming the main currency in the online world. While social scientists have successfully applied text analysis tools built by computer and information scientists to questions important to the social sciences, known as the text-as-data field, social scientists have yet to do the same with images-as-data. As the use of images on social media proliferates, images constitute a growing and mostly untapped source of knowledge about our social world. As we increasingly view each otherâ€™s lives through these GIF-ified emotions, filters, and images, it is important to understand whether online images reflect, reinforce, or have the power to challenge existing group-based inequalities.

In this project we ask two broad questions. (1) Methodologically, can we use machine-vision tools, at scale, to extract data from the content of images relevant to social science inquiry? (2) Substantively, is online image sharing bridging inter-group inequalities or reinforcing them? We explore this second question by looking at gentrification, neighborhood stigma, and the potential for marginalized communities to use online spaces to reclaim their own representations. The answer to these questions, we claim, have implications for how we understand neighborhood inequality and gentrification in contemporary society.
