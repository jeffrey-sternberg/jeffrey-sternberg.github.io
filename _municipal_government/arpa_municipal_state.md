<em>Abstract</em>
<br>
In the wake of COVID-19, the American Rescue Plan Act allocated a historic 130.7 billion dollars to local governments, expanding the autonomy of the municipal state in an attempt to contain its associated social and economic crises on the level of the local. The use of these funds has produced deep structural shifts in prevailing regimes of urban governance, leaving a host of contradictions and a shifting terrain upon which class struggles over the municipal state can be fought in the future. It remains for social movements and city residents to capitalize on these structural transformations by seizing and democratizing the municipal state, using its increased fiscal autonomy and increased state capacity to push and further a leftist urban agenda.
