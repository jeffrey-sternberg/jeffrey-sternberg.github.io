# City Owned Parcels Map
Two map Layers:
- City-owned Parcels
  - Underlying Parcels from ChiBlock Builder with underlying Address, Zoning, Status, Value, etc. information.
- Merged Parcels
  - Layer of above individual parcels merged if they were touching. Provides area in acres of merged parcels to help identify large groupings of publicly owned city parcels for development.
