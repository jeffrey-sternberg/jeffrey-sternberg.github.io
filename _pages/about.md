I am currently the Director of Research & Evaluation for the Steans Family Foundation where I have built out their data strategy and reporting system in order to track, measure, and evaluate the success of their social investments across their economic opportunity, housing, education (early childhood, K-12, post-secondary), workforce development and policy portfolios, unlocking insights to drive data-driven decision-making across the organization. The foundation’s work is place-based and centered in the westside neighborhood of North Lawndale in Chicago, which has necessitated a drilled down granular focus on the conditions on the ground to compare foundation interventions against to evaluate impact, combining a host of secondary administrative data sets, neighborhood level data collection via data-sharing agreements with anchor institutions, and novel data collection associated with foundation specific investments. I have both conducted background research and written literature reviews on specific program interventions and social issues, secondary research to depict baseline conditions and long-term trends in the neighborhood, and primary qualitative and quantitative research working with community partners and residents. The research projects conducted include studies of guaranteed income, community wealth-building, affordable housing development, STEAM schools, Pre-K seat allotments, and local workforce pipelines. This position required a deep networking and engagement with local community groups on the ground including small non-profits and service providers,  anchor institutions, planning associations, resident councils, universities, boards, and more to produce community-based participatory research.  


Before moving to Chicago, I was the Deputy Director of Research & Outcomes at The City of Detroit where I was responsible for analyzing and reporting on the impact of the $826.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds received by the city to respond to the deleterious impacts of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of the City’s neighborhoods. I provided stakeholders within the City of Detroit (Mayor’s Office, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, City Council), U.S. Treasury, and Detroit residents with research to drive their decision-making and advocacy around key policy issues. To this end, I worked with project teams to design performance metrics (long-term goals, outcomes, outputs) to track and evaluate project success, creating data collection tools and data pipelines to gather and centralize all performance, financial, demographic, employment, and programmatic data across 100+ projects-related to ARPA. I used this repository to design project and portfolio level dashboards to report on key performance indicators and project health to stakeholders. I defined evaluation frameworks to guide decision-maker interpretation of these data sources. Furthermore, I performed equity and economic analyses on these data sources, utilizing machine-learning techniques, to write reports and policy briefs on the impact of these federal funds at the level of the project, city sector, and metropolitan area. With Mayor Duggan’s mandate, I worked to build a public-facing website to showcase how Detroit’s ARPA Funds impacted the city, allowing for a data-rich drill-down exploration of the use of these funds alongside a more linear story of the portfolio itself. The goal was to deliver on the promise of government transparency and resident accountability that was pledged when accepting these funds by telling as accurate a story as we could of how the funds were used and putting all the data at the public’s fingertips.   

Before joining municipal government, I had the privilege of already being able to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the IC² Institute at UT Austin where I collaborated on a number of quantitative and qualitative projects partnering with government agencies, universities, and community organizations to research regional economic development and sustainable collaboration between communities within and outside of urban corridors towards the ends of equity, access, and empowerment. In this role, I built spatial data infrastructures to link survey responses to secondary administrative data sources across census geographies to help guide community development decisions, contributed to economic impact reports, co-authored academic publications, evaluated city programs, managed research and consulting teams, and drafted funding proposals. My work during this postdoc investigated, in various ways, the social and cultural underpinnings of economic processes geographically, focusing on collaboration at multiple scales: (1) between the UT Medical School and business community to foster innovative agglomeration economies aiming to developing project collaborations through local meet-ups, informal knowledge sharing and socialization; (2) between communities and decision-makers in the economic development process, clustering Texas communities by economic, cultural, demographic, and inequality characteristics to identify and bring together beneficial, targeted collaborations between them, working to stitch together new regional identities to facilitate this process; and (3) between the city, employers and workers, investigating interventions at the levels of trainings and workshops to disrupt exploitation between employers and day laborers at a City of Austin run Worker Center. In this position, I was exposed to the intersection of applied, academic and policy research which was foundational in expanding both the scope and scale of work I was able to perform in the future. I may have left this postdoc to go explore the world of applied research and the public sector in other cities across the country,, but I would have stayed had I known a more permanent, less temporary, position would become available, one exactly such as this. 

My previous academic work from my PhD was focused on questions related to how the machinations of the global economy sorted places into categories of winners and losers economically utilizing a varied set of qualitative and quantitative research methods. My dissertation specifically looked at how remote work, and the new forms of mobility it allowed by untethering home and work, impacted urbanization and labor markets from a global cities & global political economy perspective pre-COVID, specifically looking at the consequences of opening up a global labor market while simultaneously creating a condition where localities could court labor instead of firms directly as a model for local economic development, using multi-sited ethnography and social network analysis to chart and understand the push and pull factors guiding and anchoring this form of labor mobility. As a research assistant, I also worked on projects exploring the application of image processing and computer vision to social science inquiries, specifically using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and SVM’s to featurize and engage in binary classification of the image profiles of different cities using Flickr data. The idea was to see whether we could use computer vision to identify specific visual cues associated with a city image and through this learn something about cultural representations of different cities. With this proof of concept, we then began to ask whether we could identify and predict markers of gentrification and neighborhood change using the same methodology, triangulated using socio-economic data as a control, and then explore whether visual markers of gentrification differed by geography (neighborhood, city, etc.).  I conducted similar analyses of city image and place commodification using natural language processing methods and topic modelling on Airbnb listings to understand the narratives around how place was being sold and its impacts on neighborhood conditions & well-being. All to say, I have explored these questions continuously using different methods from ethnography to interviewing to social network analysis to image processing to natural language processing and beyond., 
Even though I have left the tenure-track behind, I am continuing to write and publish on my research projects which includes developing a book proposal, Making the Remote Class,  based on my dissertation for submission to university presses (Bloomsbury Academic & Verso). I also have a publication plan that draws on my past and present research. I am in the process of submitting to a peer-reviewed academic journal a paper about newly emerging networks of digital nomad cities and the impacts of digital nomad mobility on shifting existing global relations of production. Building off of my dissertation research on the impacts of tech labor migration on urban economies and labor markets, I have been developing a research project building a geographic social network model of US domestic migration patterns between metro areas over the past decade to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on these patterns and identify temporal communities among these metros using IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) migration data and joint learning graph representation, link clustering, and nonnegative matrix factorization. I am also writing a critical appraisal of the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act, specifically its State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, on the municipal state informed by my professional experiences tracking its impact on the City of Detroit which I am planning on submitting to the New Left Review and other critical outlets on contemporary state theory. I am also continuing to collaborate with researchers from my Postdoc to publish papers on community development studies we conducted together focusing on relocation preferences and their connections to rural community development.
