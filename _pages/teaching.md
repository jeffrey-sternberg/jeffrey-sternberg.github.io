<h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>
<p>Through my teaching, I have attempted to provide my students with a survey of diverse epistemological frameworks, social science methodologies, and research experiences to not only introduce them to skills to use in their work-lives, but also to be able to locate themselves in the worlds and institutions they occupy. In my classroom, students learn engagement, develop a sense of action, and gain an understanding of place and its role in reproducing and contesting historical social inequalities. In my courses, my teaching goal is to guide students toward a critical awareness of how society is organized that they can apply to their own work and lives. By focusing on the intersection of culture, the economy, politics and society, I have fundamentally aimed to impart to them an almost Gramsican view of social change that they can take a part in, both inside institutions of power (the state and firms in the economy), and outside of them (social, political and countercultural movements). I have attempted to expose students to the historical and social embeddedness of knowledge production and its role in reproducing systems of power, inequality and exclusion, both in the literature and through methodology.</p> 

<p>My goal has been to push students to train a critical lens on the world around them, and specifically on the types of knowledge and institutions they engage with in the course of their daily lives. I try to accomplish this through engaging in multi-disciplinarity and assigning a diversity of sources all showing plural ways of approaching “everyday” and “common sense” topics thought to only have one side to them, revealing how the political lurks behind every presentation of the ordinary. I provide students with both the techne to exist within and influence institutions of power (through instruction in data science and qualitative research methodologies) and the politics to create new social institutions and direct them towards socially liberatory ends.</p> 

<p>I have taught courses in Social Theory and Digital Methods for Social Science & Humanities at the undergraduate level and have worked as a Digital Teaching Integration Specialist at Northeastern University’s NULab for Texts, Maps and Networks consulting with faculty across the university to design and deliver relevant digital skills workshops within existing courses. I also completed my comprehensive exams for my doctorate in the sub-fields of urban studies and globalization which has prepared me to teach classes across topics such as global development & political economy, the growth & decline of cities and suburbs in the US, global urbanism and world-city networks, the future of work and place, global markets & local cultures, and urban policy & community development.</p>

<p>For my Social Theory course, I designed a syllabus that presented a historicized imminent critique of the sociological cannon’s development, provincializing the canon and locating it in the historical periods, geographies and social standpoints it was generated in. I highlighted the erasures and lacuna existing in each theoretician and used each subsequent theorist to interrogate and expand the sub-altern view of society. I had students keep a daily theory journal where they were instructed to draw parallels between the theory they were reading, their existing knowledge bases, and everyday life, activating their personal experiences as sources of theory and knowledge capable of interacting with existing theory and generating new critiques and insights. Using a range of real-world examples and guided discussions of current events, I aimed to create a welcoming and supportive classroom environment for students to explore complex and challenging topics.</p>  

<p>In my course Digital Methods for Social Science and Humanities, I taught a whole cohort of undergrads who had no coding skills to be fluent enough in python to develop their own data-driven projects, moving from research questions to data collection to analysis and beyond. For this course, I developed a number of novel tutorials in natural language processing, GIS, APIs and Data Collection, finding and merging data sets, and structuring unstructured data. Alongside these tutorials, I assigned readings and gave lectures on the development of the digital humanities and computational social sciences, placing the advent of big data, computation and new forms of media within the development of cultural theory more broadly. This also meant grounding the use of data and its construction within global political economy and histories of colonialism, highlighting how our current use and production of data is shaped by existing inequalities and power relations, reinforcing them in some instances while also opening up the possibility for their challenge. In these courses, and in my role as a Digital Integration Teaching Fellow designing workshops and digital methods tutorials for classes across the social science and humanities, I engaged students in robust conversations of data ethics, discussing how their own data is captured and collected, exposing them to their digital footprint, explaining how maps hide and shape power, how data systems and the institutions that create and manage data bias the whole system, and how data makes certain populations visible or concealed.</p>
  
<p>I continued this work as a Digital Integration Teaching Specialist at the NULab, where I consulted with professors in a wide variety of disciplines (economics, political science, English & literature, health sciences, sociology, international affairs) to design workshops and tutorials that would integrate and deliver digital methods training into their curriculum including but not limited to statistics, natural language processing, data ethics, application programming interfaces, GIS and podcasting.</p> 

<p>One exemplary tutorial I created and delivered was for an Urban Sociology course where I made a tableau mapping tutorial that introduced students to the City of Boston Data Portals and used Boston building permit data from the portal to operationalize, model and identify how gentrification was proceeding differently by neighborhood according to the type of building permits most prevalent in that neighborhood – demolition, addition, new construction, etc. This tutorial was one in a four-part module showing students how to apply computational methods to urban research questions, with students utilizing these methods and datasets in their final semester projects investigating social issues in specific Boston neighborhoods. Subsequent workshops introduced students to ethnographic research methodology, and various platforms for research presentation and delivery (Story Maps, WordPress, podcasts). </p>

<p>I have taken the structure of this workshop series and integrated it into the <em>Applied Learning Seminar - Policy, Inequality & Histories of Uneven Devleopment </em> I taught at the University of Michigan, using the workshops and neighborhood project to accompany a historical, theoretical and research-based survey of urbanization in the US. By building in this experiential component to a more traditional survey course on urban studies, I teach students how to activate and operationalize the various theories and concepts they learn throughout the semester to locate an urban process of their interest to study on the neighborhood level, construct research questions and select appropriate research methods, and expose them to various formats for the dissemination of their findings, all working to provide them with the skills and ability to place their study in the broader context of historical trends of urbanization. Students prepared multimedia presentations to deliver their findings and possible policy solutions to the problems they identified.</p>

<p>In my professional life in municipal government, I have also acted as leadership on Data Strategy and Performance Management, designing and delivering seminars to hundreds of Data Stewards in all city departments to help them learn how to report on their ARPA project’s performance and further analyze their administrative data to acquire insights to guide their planning and program strategy. This work is a part of a larger initiative I led on the part of the Data Strategy & Analytics Team alongside the City’s Budget Office and Lean Process Improvement Team to instill a larger cultural shift within the city towards data literacy, data-driven decision-making, and performance management.</p> 

<p>In addition to these teaching experiences, I also have a number of courses that I have both prepped and am in the process of designing, the former of which includes The Growth & Decline of Cities and Suburbs, Perspectives on International Political Economy and Development, and Post-Structural Theory. I am in the process of designing courses on Urban Political Economy and Culture, The Digitization of Everyday Life, Social Theory through Literature and Film, The Sociology of Utopia & The Future, and Local Community & Economic Development across the Urban-Rural Divide. My research and teaching have given me ample experience in mentoring undergraduate and graduate students both inside and outside the classroom. I have mentored and supervised a number of undergraduate and graduate research assistants on various projects which has included teaching research methods workshops, supervising consulting teams, and engaging in one-on-one skill development and mentoring. To this end,, I put together a number of workshops to prepare undergraduate research assistants for using geospatial data to inform community & economic development policy, teaching them to process, manipulate, merge and prepare geospatial datasets at various scales of census geography, transforming these into shapefiles which they load to ArcGIS online, creating online spatial data repositories, and making publication-ready maps to aid in the completion of team research projects, the trajectory of which leaves students with a portfolio of work and demonstratable skills they can take on the job market after they graduate.</p> 

<p>I do not limit my relationships with students to mentoring but also to advocacy on their behalf and helping them organize, having performed various kinds of department service as a graduate student including serving as a graduate committee representative, and intellectual events committee representative. In these roles I drafted labor-relations guidelines outlining what graduate student workers in the department could and could not be asked to do and provided guidance for dealing with labor grievances in the department. I also helped organize workshops, brown bags, and town halls between the students and faculty to get at the heart of these issues. My concern with student well-being extended beyond department issues to the college and university as a whole, working to bring together students across departments to share how they organized within their departments and coordinate the use of our graduate committees to advocate for our rights and protections at the college and university level. I also sat on a dean’s advisory committee fighting for more resources for graduate students at the bottom of the resource chain, more methodological training, and removing barriers to student success. I am committed to the engaging with and shaping the discipline of sociology and the organization of academia in general, an effort I will only continue wherever I end up. I greatly enjoy teaching social science to students early in their college careers, where we have the opportunity to delve into topics and learn new ways of thinking about social structures and inequalities.</p>
