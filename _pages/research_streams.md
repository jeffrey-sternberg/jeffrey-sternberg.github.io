    title: "Remote Work & Urbanization"
    excerpt: "My dissertation specifically looked at how remote work, and the new forms of mobility it allowed by untethering home and work, impacted urbanization and labor markets from a global cities & global political economy perspective pre-COVID, specifically looking at the consequences of opening up a global labor market while simultaneously creating a condition where localities could court labor instead of firms directly as a model for local economic development, using multi-sited ethnography and social network analysis to chart and understand the push and pull factors guiding and anchoring this form of labor mobility."
